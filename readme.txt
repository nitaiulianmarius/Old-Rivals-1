To compile Old Rivals 1 you need to download SFML graphic libraries. Also you can enjoy the game downloading it from github release folder https://github.com/nitaiulianmarius

I used the SFML C++ graphics library to render images, manipulate the game window and events, and TCP to send chat messages and other data between 2 players who are in a room but canâ€™t see each other. Using mouse events they send projectiles to the other half of the room to destroy the opponent.
Technologies: C++, SFML, TCP, Algebra
